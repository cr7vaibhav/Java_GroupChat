# Java Group Chat

This project uses Java sockets and multithreading to create a terminal-based group chat application.

## Key Features

- **Java Sockets:** Enables communication between multiple clients.
- **Multithreading:** Handles multiple users simultaneously for real-time messaging.

## How It Works

1. **Server Initialization:** The server listens for incoming client connections.
2. **Client Connection:** Clients connect to the server using sockets.
3. **Thread Management:** Each client runs in a separate thread for concurrent communication.
4. **Message Broadcasting:** Messages from clients are broadcasted to all users in real-time.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Communication:** Immediate message delivery and reception.
- **Efficiency:** Multithreading manages multiple connections without performance issues.
