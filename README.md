# Java Group Chat

This project employs Java sockets and multithreading to create a comprehensive terminal-based group chat application.

## Key Features

- **Java Sockets:** Utilizes Java sockets to facilitate seamless communication between multiple clients.
- **Multithreading:** Ensures that the chat server can handle multiple users simultaneously, providing a smooth and efficient real-time messaging experience.
- **Scalability:** The combination of these technologies allows for a robust and scalable group chat solution within a terminal environment.

## How It Works

1. **Server Initialization:** The server initializes and listens for incoming client connections.
2. **Client Connection:** Clients connect to the server using sockets.
3. **Thread Management:** Each client connection is managed in a separate thread, allowing multiple users to communicate concurrently.
4. **Message Broadcasting:** Messages from clients are broadcasted to all connected users in real-time.

## Benefits

- **Real-Time Communication:** Ensures immediate message delivery and reception among all participants.
- **Efficiency:** Multithreading enhances the application's ability to manage numerous connections without performance degradation.
- **Terminal-Based:** Provides a lightweight, text-based interface suitable for various environments.
